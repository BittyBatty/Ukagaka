Riccardo has several fun and interesting little features to him that I hope you will enjoy. First I want to warn you that he will flinch from your cursor, but don't be alarmed! You cannot accidentally punch him as punching him is prohibited by me (and his code). There are no consequences to making him flinch, either, so feel free to open the menu despite his flinching from you. 

Next, I will say his relationship increases at a somewhat slow rate. Giving him things will increase his relationship as well as chatting with him. He's a jumpy person and he greatly appreciates being shown kindness despite his grumpy attitude. 

As your relationship with Riccardo increases, he will reveal more of his interests and be more appreciative of your company (including flinching less from you). Eventually, he will even allow you to pet him. When he is truly comfortable with you, you can even follow him back home to help him find things.

One other thing, make sure you are giving him plenty of blood as his need for it will decrease and he starts complaining if he is thirsty. 

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. You can find me by opening the right click menu where I've provided plenty of different sites I frequent. That is also where you can update this little vampire nerd. 

Thank you so much for downloading him! - Fursie
