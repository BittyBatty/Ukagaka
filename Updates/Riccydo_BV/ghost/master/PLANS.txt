Item Menu - maybe find these items in mini game instead
- Gloves
- Scarf
- Necklace
- Travel guide "I've always wanted to travel, maybe you'd like to as well?"

Surfaces
- Ruffled hair, surprised petting pose
- Deeply enjoying pets pose, eyes closed, head tilts, ears relaxed, purring
- won't read in your presence until comfortable

Dialogue
- Asks if you like the cold, variable for this

OnBoot Dialogue
- Look at surfaces, some are set to his default pose and shouldn't be

VAGUE IDEAS
- grungy up his clothes (holes, dirt, patches) because he is homeless after all

Mini Game
- scavenge for things with him in a kind of mini game (animate a screen so you can go left right, up or down and this randomizes places to scavenge? Perhaps pulls from a pool of random surfaces?)
- \s[?] "There's nothing there"
- \s[?] "There's a bunch of brush, you see something shining from within, check it out (yes or look somewhere else)"
- HITBOXES to click on places on the map!!!!!!!!!
	I think I'm going to base it on collisions
	Like you can double click to go to the junkyard, river, convenience store, or river
	And from there you can do like point click to scavenge stuff
	Need to figure out how to set up variables for this
	I obviously don't want him to exit out of the game before you're done
	Surface restore?
	But do I need to do a restore variable for every individual screen of the game to keep it there until you're done with it?
	Hm...
	I'm sure there's an easier way
	
	Passivemode will disable the surfacerestore
	you can also set a Mode by having a variable to represent if a game is occurring 
		OnSurfaceRestore 
		{
			if game == 1
			{
				//Nothing occurs here if the game is on
			}
			else 
			{
				// the basic surface restore
				"\0\s[0]"
			}
		}
- Envelopes for getting things, not getting things, getting junk, getting valuable things, etc.
-  test if variables work within envelopes
	envelope
	{
		gotathing += 1
		"stuff"
		"morestuff"
	}
